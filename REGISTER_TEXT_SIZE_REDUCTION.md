# Register Section Text Size Reduction

## Overview
The "Join a Program" / "Ready to Transform Your Future" section header and description text sizes have been reduced to better fit the layout and match the user's request.

## Changes Made

### Register Title (`.register-title`)
- **Font Size**: Reduced from `2.4rem` to `2rem`.
- **Why**: To make the title less dominant and more balanced with the surrounding content.

### Register Description (`.register-description`)
- **Font Size**: Reduced from `1.1rem` to `0.95rem`.
- **Why**: To improve readability and density, making the description text more compact.

## Visual Impact
- The section now appears more streamlined.
- The text hierarchy remains clear, but the overall visual weight of the text is reduced.
- Better alignment with the form elements on the right (if present in a two-column layout).

## Files Modified
- `styles.css`

## Verification
- Check the "Ready to Transform Your Future?" section on the relevant page (likely `about.html` or `programs.html`).
- Ensure the text is smaller but still legible.
